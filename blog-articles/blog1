REACT NATIVE
Use react components to make an app for a phone with ios or android. It is not html. It uses native components. You can't use div. You instead use things like <View /> or <Text />.

It is not a webview.So no html but the classes look very similar. Just like we have npm or npx create-reaact-app for the web. There is a starter package on the React-web-site. You will still use javascript, then it compiles it down to java or swift. You can publish right to the App store from react-native.

So it's a chance for those of us comforatble with javascript to build phone-apps without having to learn swift or java. I'm hoping to try and re-create some of my webapps with react-native in order to have cross-platform developer skills.

Thanks for reading, check out the React site for an intro and get started with there step-by-step intro app today.
